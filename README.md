## What is it
This project aims helping SCIFI-UFF study group locating EDUROAM's routers inside university's buildings. 
This application makes SNMP requests to these devices to discover in which channel and power they are operating on.
Hopefully, this data will be useful for helping configuring routers better since devices close to one another operating at the same channel are succeptible to more interference.
